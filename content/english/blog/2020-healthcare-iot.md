## Work in progress! Be patient ðŸš§

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of Leeriest sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!-- 
The project managed by Code-runners
Device that collect metrics from different medical apparatuses that implements Bluetooth protocol for medical use.
Data is collected from apparatuses such as BPSystolic, BPDiastolic, Pulse, BloodSugar etc..
Then the device push collected metrics to Azure IoT Hub where data is stored/processed etc..

## Workflow
The end user turn on the device,
Go to the portal and for a specific patient clicks "start measure",
Metrics collector device is triggered and waits for available apparatuses,
When measurements done from the apparatuses, data is collected and send to the hub.
