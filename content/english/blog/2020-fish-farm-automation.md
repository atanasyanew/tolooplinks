<!-- ## Fish farm -->

## About the client

The domain of the company falls into ``Aquaculture``.

Innovative fish farm located in northwestern Bulgaria.

## The Mission

The farm aim to provide clean, well feed, bio and delicious fishery products to end clients across Europe.

## The Challenges

The fish farm factory consist of about 10 large water tanks where the fish grows, with additional few smaller for breeding the new generation.

Many and important metrics are required in order to have sustainable ecosystem, such as pH, temperatures, oxygen, water levels, etc..

Our challenges was to manage all that sensors, control units, pumps, filters, relays etc.. from different providers, make them act together.

## How we managed

With many conversations.. anyway...

The solution we provided, can be separated in two parts - ``gateways`` and ``server``.

**The Gateway..**

We create a generic embedded device with custom hardware for the purpose.

In other words the gateway, act as middleware between the vital units and the server.

The developed custom embedded device is smart enough when a new sensor is connected to it.

The device provides an easy configurable technique to control/add new unit to many available general-purpose input/output

**The Server..**

The server is decentralize, located in the farm.

The stream of data managed by developed for the purpose ETL.

Data is stored in database optimized for time series.

Web-based UI developed and provided in order visualize metrics and explore the historical data.

UI for system specific configurations, controlling, manual and automatic system behavior, thresholds, alerts, notification channels, etc..

Mobile notifications also available.

The system is divided in multiple services, scalable and robust, managed by containers using ``Docker``.
